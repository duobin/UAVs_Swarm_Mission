# Autonomous UAVs Swarm Mission

## 1. DESCRIPTON
This is an autonomous quadcopter swarm project. The purpose of this project is to achieve a designated mission by multiple drone cooperation. I developed and assembled two sets of the drone as the hardware platform. One set consists of six drones modified from 3DR IRIS+ drone, the other set consists of four drones made from scratch. I also developed a drone swarm control software package, including the functions of flight control, multi-drone communication, multi-drone coordination, stereo vision, failure handle, and so on.

There are three subprojects in this repository. 1) The Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight is the earliest developed subproject, which achieves four drones formation flight. Four drones can form any formation dynamically in flight. This drone swarm can be easily expanded, i.e., you can add more drones to this troop. 2) The Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight subject is developed based on Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight. This is an improved version of Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight, in which the functions are modularized and more functions are added. The drone troop achieves curved path flight by specified curvature radius and degrees. An execution queue is implemented to achieve complex path designation. 3) Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter is the latest developed subproject. It is developed based on Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight, with lots of more function added. In this project, four drones cooperate to find and destroy four balloons. The four balloons are in four different colors, and each drone is intended to find the ballon with specified color and then destroy it. The advanced stereo vision camera plus sonar system is designed and equipped on each drone. With this stereo vision system, the drone is able to find the ballon and calculate the distance of the ballon. Then the drone can adjust its heading and altitude to lock the balloon.

For all the three subprojects, there is one drone acts as a leader (commander), and the other drones act as followers (soldiers). The leader drone plans the mission and sends real-time commands to all the follower drones, and the follower drones carry out required actions following the leader's instructions. All the drones in the troop are identical, which makes the decentralized swarm structure feasible. With a proper negotiation strategy, it is easy to reassign the leader drone. The mission is still achievable by other drones even if the leader fails.

</p>

#### b) AUTOPILOT SYSTEM
The autopilot system shipped with iris+ drone is [Pixhawk](Hardware_Configuration/3DR_IRIS/README_PICS/Pixhawk.jpg) with firmware ArduCopter v3.2. I upgraded the firmeare to ArduCopter v3.3.3. All the software packages are tested with ArduCopter v3.3.3, and are guaranteed to work well. Please refer to [pixhawk official website](https://pixhawk.org) for details. The firmware is from ArduPilot open source project. Please refer to [ArduPilot official website](http://ardupilot.org/) for the introduction on this project and the instruction on how to flash firmeware and set parameters.
```
- Autopilot: Pixhawk 1
- Firmware: ArduCopter v3.3.3 (upgraded from original v3.2)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="Hardware_Configuration/3DR_IRIS/README_PICS/Pixhawk.jpg" height="300">
</p>

#### c) POSITIONING SYSTEM
The 3DR iris+ drone is shipped with GPS. This project uses its original GPS.
```
- GPS: 3DR uBlox GPS with Compass (LEA-6H module, 5 Hz update)
```

#### d) ON BOARD COMPUTING SYSTEM (COMPANION COMPUTER)
This project need a high performance companion computer to do mission planning, computer vision task, and other computing-intensive tasks. However, the original iris+ done does not have a companion computer. After research, I found that the intel UP board is the best companion computer for this project. A [power module](Hardware_Configuration/3DR_IRIS/README_PICS/Power_module_5V_3A.jpg) is needed to power the companion computer.
```
- Single Board Computer: Intel UP board
- Processor: Intel® Atom™ x5-Z8350 Processor (2M Cache, up to 1.92 GHz),
             Quad Core CPU with 64 bit architecture
- Memory: 4GB DDR3L-1600
- Storage Capacity: 32 GB eMMC
- OS: Ubilinux
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="Hardware_Configuration/3DR_IRIS/README_PICS/Intel_UP_board_layout.jpg" height="300">
</p>

#### e) STEREO VISION CAMERA AND SONAR SYSTEM
Original iris+ drone does not have any vision system. I designed and assembled the stereo vision camare to equipe it on each drone. Please refer to my other repository [Stereo_Vision_Camera](https://github.com/FlyingCatAlex/Stereo_Vision_Camera) for more detail. With stereo vision camera, drones are able to detect and locate objects in 3D frame. A [Maxbotix I2CXL-MaxSonar-EZ4 High Performance Sonar](https://www.maxbotix.com) is added to each iris+ drone for obstacle detection. The sonar sensor is installed in the center of the stereo vision camera. The solar sensor works with stereo vison camarea to locate objects accurately.

</p>

#### f) COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
Original iris+ drone is shipped with RC radio and 3DR radio. An operator can control iris+ maually with RC radio, or control it through ground station installed on computer with 3DR radio. In this project, the mission planning tasks are done by on board computer (companion computer), so there is no need to use a ground station. I removed the 3DR radio and reserve the telemetry port for on board computer. The port TELEM 2 on pixhawk is connected to companion computer via [USB to serial adapter](Hardware_Configuration/3DR_IRIS/README_PICS/USB_to_Serial_Adapter.jpg), and the port TELEM 1 on pixhawk is connected to RC radio receiver. Please refer to [this guide](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/odroid-via-mavlink.html) to hook up pixhawk with companion computer. The communication between drones are achieved via WiFi. The communication between drones is achieved by wifi via wireless router on ground. A [USB WiFi adapter](Hardware_Configuration/3DR_IRIS/README_PICS/Panda_Wireless_USB_WiFi_Adapter.jpg) is plugged to the usb port of companion computer to send and receive messages.
```
- Communication with Companion Computer: USB to serial port adapter
- Communication with Other Drones: Wifi via ground-based wireless router
- Manual Control: RC radio shipped with original 3DR iris+ drone
```

</p>

Below is the flight test. All drones work well. The flight time is more than 40 minutes per fully charge with all payload (Lidar, Stereo Vision Camera, Companion computer, and so on), which is sufficient for most missions. The flight time is much longer than most of other off-the-shelf products in market.

## 3. SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION
### 1) CONFIGURE OS ENVIRONMENT
To work with drone, the companion computer should be able to start and login without password when power on. Also, to communicate with other drones via wifi, each computer need a static IP address. The flight control code should run automatically on boot. Please go through the procedures below to setup OS environment. (More details will be added when I get time :) )
```
- Install and setup LightDM to enable the companion computer auto login.
- Edit /etc/network/interfaces to assign a static IP address to each drone.
- Set the grub default boot entry, and set the grub timeout to 0.
- Edit /etc/rc.local to add the auto run item. (To avoid frequently modify this file, 
  you can write the path and name of an script, say run_on_boot.sh, in rc.local file, 
  then write all auto run items in run_on_boot.sh.)
```

### 2) INSTALL PACKAGES
We need openCV for stereo vision system, please follow the instruction below to compile and install openCV 3.1.
```
# This script install opencv 3.1.0 for python and other needed components. 
# This script is written according to the tutorial on pyimagesearch website.
# You can save this script as install_opencv3.1_UP_board.sh. Then run . install_opencv3.1_UP_board.sh as root.

# Step 1: Open up a terminal and update the apt-get  package manager followed by upgrading any pre-installed packages:
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# Step 2: Our environment is now all setup — we can proceed to change to our home directory, pull down OpenCV from GitHub, and checkout the 3.1.0  version:
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git
cd opencv
sudo git checkout 3.1.0

# we also need the opencv_contrib repo as well. Without this repository, we won’t have access to standard keypoint detectors and local invariant descriptors (such as SIFT, SURF, etc.) that were available in the OpenCV 2.4.X version. We’ll also be missing out on some of the newer OpenCV 3.0 features like text detection in natural images:
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib.git
cd opencv_contrib
sudo git checkout 3.1.0
# make sure that you checkout the same version for opencv_contrib  that you did for opencv  above, otherwise you could run into compilation errors.

# setup the build:
cd ~/opencv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
	-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
	-D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=OFF \
	-D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \
	-D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_contrib/modules \

## 4. SOFTWARE ARCHITECHTURE

As mentioned in [DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/FlyingCatAlex/Autonomous_UAVs_Swarm_Mission/blob/master/README.md#1-descripton), there are three subprojects in the repository. Technically, they are three different developemt phases of one project. The objective of the entire project is to develope a autonomous drone swarm platform to performe designated multi-drone coorperation missions. This platform including hardwares and softwares. During the early development phase, the maily objective is to assure the feasibility of the system design. I performed intensive hardware and software test while develop [Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight](Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight/) and [Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight](Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight/). All the components of the system work properly. The [Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter](Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter/) subproject is the final product. The balloon hunter mission can be considered as a demonstration.

1. [Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight](Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight/) is the firstly developed code set. Its architecture is very simple:
  - [formation_main_leader.py](Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight/formation_main_leader.py) is the main function for the leader drone. The mission is planed in this code. This code also coordinates all drones in a mission. The client and server services start on boot, to send commands to and receive status reports from the follower drones.
  - [formation_main_follower.py](Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight/formation_main_follower.py) is the main function for the follower code. It starts the client and server services on the follower drone. All the things that follower drones do are receiving and executing the commands from leader drone, and send their own status to the leader drone on demand.
  - [formation_function.py](Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight/formation_function.py) is the shared code for both leader and follower drones. All the functions which may be called by leader drone or follower drone are in this code.

2. [Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight](Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight/) is a improved version based on [Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight](Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight/). In this subproject, some new functions are added to achieve more complicated flight track. An execution queue is implemented to store the movement commands. The architechture is similar to its predecessor's.
  - [curvature_flight_main_leader.py](Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight/curvature_flight_main_leader.py) is similar to [formation_main_leader.py](Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight/formation_main_leader.py)
  - [curvature_flight_main_follower.py](Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight/curvature_flight_main_follower.py) is similar to [formation_main_follower.py](Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight/formation_main_follower.py)
  - [curvature_flight_function.py](Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight/curvature_flight_function.py) is similar to [formation_function.py](Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight/formation_function.py)

3. [Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter](Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter/) is the final version of this project. Though its name is balloon hunter, it is able to execute all missions completed by [Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight](Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight/) and [Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight](Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight/). The stereo vision system is implemented, which enables the drone troop to perform more complicated missions involving object detection and recognition requirement.

  - [balloon_finder_leader.py](Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter/balloon_finder_leader.py) is the main function runs on the leader drone.
  - [balloon_finder_follower.py](Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter/balloon_finder_follower.py) is the main function runs on the follower drones.
  - [MyPythonModule](Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter/MyPythonModule/) - A module used by both leader drone and follower drones. All functions are in this module.  
    - [DroneControlFunction.py](Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter/MyPythonModule/DroneControlFunction.py) is drone control functions.
    - [ObjectDetection.py](Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter/MyPythonModule/ObjectDetection.py) is stereo vision and object detection functions.
    - [v4l2.py](Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter/MyPythonModule/v4l2.py) is video for linux 2 (v4l2) device python API.
    - [v4l2_device.py](Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter/MyPythonModule/v4l2_device.py) is stereo vision camera device class.

When all drones are ready to take off, leader drone commands follower drones take off. When all drones complete mission or timeout, leader drone commands follower drones return to launch point.

#### RESULT

##### 1. TWO DRONES MISSION
###### TEST 1
Iris1 (the leader) found the red balloon and try to hit into it, but its propeller was wrapped by the rope that hung the balloon. Iris2 (the follower) did not find the yellow balloon. The reason is that the yellow color is not detected.

###### TEST 2
Two drone balloon hunter mission test. Iris1 (the leader) found the red balloon and destroyed it successfully. Iris2 (the follower) detected the yellow balloon but finally missed it. The yellow color is detected this time, but the exposure is not appropriate, which casue only part of the yellow balloon is recognized. This cause the vision-detected result not stable. The iris2 drone finally missed the yellow balloon.

##### 2. FOUR DRONES MISSION
Four drones were programed to find four balloons with different colors and destroy them. Iris1's target is the red balloon; iris2's target is the yellow balloon; iris3's target is the black balloon; iris4's target is the blue balloon. Iris1 found its target and destroyed it. Iris2 detected its target, but can not confirm it. It failed to destroy it's target. The dark cloud confused iris3, and iris3 failed to detect the black balloon. Iris4 detected its target, the blue balloon at first, but cannot confirm it. Finally iris4 lost it's target.

## 8. FUTURE WORK
Flight tests showed that the vision system did not work well with only color and shape detection method. The machine learning algorithm should be added to object detection module. Some advanced hardware features such as 360 degree lidar scanner are not fully implemented. 
- Add Machine Learning Algorithm to Object Detection Module.
- Improve Stereo Vision System.
- Develop Obstacle Avoidance Feature with 360 degree lidar scanner.
- Develop SLAM Algorithm.
- Auto Re-configuration.
